            regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz
            Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible
            to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were
            rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be
