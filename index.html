                  <p class="hometext">In 2012, from the sun and sand of Goa, a team of automotive enthusiasts set up on
                        a mission to build an
                        open wheel, open cockpit formula type race car. After a couple of years of research and effort,
                        the
                        team was realized in 2014 and was called "Team Grease Monkeys", which has now become the
                        official
                        Formula Student team of Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani - K. K. Birla Goa
                        Campus. <br> <br> The
                        team began its journey by participating in the SAEINDIA Supra event held at Formula racing
                        circuit in
                        Coimbatore under the name ' Grease Monkeys' with the car SIEG 1.0. Since then the team has been
                        participating at Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida over the last 3 years. Thus
                        started the
                        SIEG legacy. Over the years the team has been the sole participant from the state of Goa. The
                        most
                        recent car SIEG 3.0 participated in the SAE Supra 2017 event and received accolades from the
                        judges.
                        With a 50+ strong team, immense knowledge and sheer dedication towards motorsports, the team is
                        ready
                        to take on upcoming challenges in the 2018-19 season.</p>
